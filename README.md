## How It Works

1. **PDF Upload**: The app extracts and processes section-based content using `PyPDF2`.
2. **Embedding & Indexing**: It generates vector embeddings and indexes them using FAISS.
3. **RAG Querying**: Questions are answered using relevant chunks retrieved from the vector store and passed to Mistral AI.
4. **Content Generation**: Summaries, quizzes, and flashcards are created using context-aware prompts.
5. **Streamlit Interface**: The app displays all outputs through an interactive and responsive interface.
